        <strong>Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</strong> has shown its impact in various fields, including diagnostics and disease prediction. For example, IBM Watson Health (now Merative) has made significant strides in disease diagnosis and treatment. Other research, like that from PSG College, has achieved over 70% accuracy in predicting heart disease using <strong>Naive Bayes</strong> and <strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong>, two common <strong>Machine Learning</strong> algorithms.

        In this article, we explore a public dataset on mental health in the tech industry, creating a classification model with <strong>K-means</strong>, an unsupervised learning algorithm for grouping data. The dataset is hosted on Kaggle, and you can download it <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h3>Key Technologies Used</h3>
    <p>
        We use <strong>Google Colab</strong> as the development environment and rely on the <strong>Pandas</strong> library for data manipulation. To implement the model, we utilize <strong>PyCaret</strong>, an open-source library designed to simplify the usage of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> algorithms. Other popular options like <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>PyTorch</strong> are also mentioned as potential alternatives.
